You received a task to model an Airline's internal structure. A Flight has two Pilots, three Flight Attendants. Design the model based on the following requirements:
Every Airline Employee has a name and birth date

You have to store which languages flight attendants speak from the relevant ones (English, German, Spanish, Russian).

Every flight has a unique identifier and a language from the list above.

Pilots can be either Captain or Co-pilot on a flight. A Co-pilot on a flight can be captain on another one.

Pilots get premium quality Analog Compass but only once, sometime after they got employed

We should be able to check if a flight is ready to take off (with checking every Employee whether they are ready or not); the conditions of the clearance are:

The Captain and the Co-pilot have received their Compasses already.

All the Attendants speak the language of the flight.

Log the steps of the clearance check (passed / failed, and why)!
